# üêö Kali Linux VM Lab  
## Deploying Kali Linux in Azure for Future Pentesting Labs

---

## üöÄ Why I Created This Lab

Before diving deeper into ethical hacking simulations, I needed to get comfortable provisioning my own virtual machines. This lab walks through how I deployed a Kali Linux VM using Microsoft Azure and connected to it using SSH.

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è What I Did

### Step 1: Chose the Kali Image

I searched for an image that included the latest version of Kali Linux. I made sure to use a supported publisher and verified that I had permissions to deploy the VM.

### Step 2: Provisioned the VM in Azure

- Region: East US  
- Image: Kali Linux by "kali-linux"  
- Authentication type: Password (since it's what I‚Äôm most comfortable with right now)  
- Opened port 22 for SSH

---

### Step 3: Verified It Was Running

After provisioning, I made sure the VM status was ‚ÄúRunning‚Äù and grabbed the public IP address to connect.

---

### Step 4: Connected Using SSH

I used my terminal and ran:

```bash
ssh feeadmin@<your-ip-address>
```

I entered the password I set during provisioning. Once inside, I used simple commands like `ls` and `uname -a` to confirm I was in a Kali environment.

## üìù Reflection

This lab was more than just setting up a virtual machine. It helped me build comfort with cloud resources, networking ports, and managing Linux systems remotely. It also set the foundation for future hands-on hacking labs.
